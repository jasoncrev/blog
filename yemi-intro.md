## What's Yemi?

(rhymes with the name 'Jimmy')

Yemi is a blogging platform with two core values:

1. Own and control your data

    This is why we chose to source your articles from a place you control - your git repo, not our servers. If you decide to leave the platform, there's nothing to export. Yemi simply presents your thoughts to readers in a beautiful way.

2. Use familiar tools

    Why login to someone's platform to write, when you can do it from your favorite code editor?

## Who is Yemi designed for?

Simply put, lovers of git and markdown - or those who learn to love git and markdown. In other words, articles on Yemi need to be written in markdown and stored in a git repo.

Currently, our markdown standards come from CommonMark and the git platform we support is GitHub. If you'd like us to expand to other git sources in the future, let us know via [email](mailto:jason@malynium.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yemi_blog).

If you're interested in Yemi, but are unfamiliar with git and markdown, you can learn more by checking out [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org) and [GitHub](https://github.com).

## How do I get started?

You can head over to our [Docs](https://yemi.blog/docs). If you already have a GitHub account, you can login at [Yemi](https://yemi.blog).

### We hope you enjoy using Yemi
